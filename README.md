## 🛠️ Customization

All content (profile, experience, skills, projects, etc.) is stored in **TypeScript files located in the `config/` directory**.

To customize:

```bash
/config/
├── education.ts      # Education history
├── experience.ts     # Work experience
├── projects.ts       # Portfolio projects
```

Just open these files and update the values — no need to touch any component logic!
